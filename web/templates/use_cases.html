        Our model offers practical value for <strong>coaching staff, analysts, and professional football teams</strong>. 
        By measuring ball movement patterns through the <em>Hurst exponent</em>, we provide tools to:
    </p>

    <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem; padding-left: 1.2rem;text-align: left;"">
        <li>Identify when your team maintains control versus when possession becomes disorganized.</li>
        <li>Spot match phases where team structure breaks down or becomes too predictable.</li>
        <li>Understand tactical responses to pressing, goals, or system changes.</li>
        <li>Optimize training to align with desired possession styles and tempo control.</li>
        <li>Enhance scouting reports or performance analysis with a deeper tactical layer.</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;text-align: left;">
        Moreover, <strong>sports tech companies</strong> and startups working on predictive analytics or tactical visualization can leverage our model to create next-generation tools for football intelligence.

<!-- CLOSING REMARKS -->
<section class="hero" >
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">A Tool Built for the Real Game</h2>
    <p>
        While we include humorous examples to connect with football culture, the foundation of our work is built on 
        rigorous data analysis, mathematical modeling and real-world relevance.
    </p>
    <p>
        By translating possession dynamics into measurable indicators like the Hurst exponent, our project opens the door 
        to <strong>objective tactical diagnostics</strong> and <strong>actionable insights</strong> for coaches, analysts, and data science teams in professional clubs.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project is not just a theoretical exercise — it's a tool designed to integrate with modern football workflows, 
        helping teams gain a competitive edge through intelligent interpretation of the game.
