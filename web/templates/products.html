    <h1>Modelling Football with Fractional Brownian Motion</h1>
    <p>
        In this project, we applied a classical mathematical model — <strong>Brownian motion</strong> — to football, aiming to understand and predict how the ball moves during possessions.
        We generated over <strong>50,000 synthetic possessions</strong> using <strong>fractional Brownian motion</strong>, adjusting the <em>Hurst exponent (H)</em>, which quantifies movement patterns from chaotic to structured.
    </p>
    <p>
        Machine learning models were trained on these synthetic sequences to predict H using features like distance, duration, speed, and angles. Once validated, they were applied to real matches to analyze playing styles and tactical behavior.

    <h2> Impact of Match Events on Hurst Exponent (H)</h2>
    <p>
        To explore how match events affect possession dynamics, we analyzed the average change in H (∆H) before and after:
    </p>
    <ul class="no-bullets">
        <li>• Goals scored and conceded</li>
        <li>• Red cards (for and against)</li>
        <li>• Substitutions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        ∆H was computed by comparing the mean H of possessions before vs. after each event, helping us understand whether they disrupt or stabilize ball movement.
    </p>

    <h3>Figure: Average Change in H after Key Events</h3>
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/delta_events.png') }}" alt="Delta H After Events">

    <ul class="no-bullets">
        <li><strong>Goals in favor:</strong> ∆H = +0.002 → minimal impact</li>
        <li><strong>Goals conceded:</strong> ∆H = −0.006 → minimal impact</li>
        <li><strong>Red card received:</strong> ∆H = −0.112 → major disruption and randomness</li>
        <li><strong>Red card in favor:</strong> ∆H = +0.066 → improved possession control</li>
        <li><strong>Substitutions:</strong> ∆H = +0.005 → negligible short-term effect</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The sharp drop after a red card against is the most evident, suggesting tactical breakdown. However, matches often stabilize later, with H recovering to previous levels.
    </p>

    <h3>Figure: Hurst Exponent Evolution in a Match with a Red Card</h3>
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/evolucion_roja.png') }}" alt="Evolution of H After Red Card">

    <p>
        After the red card, H drops sharply, reflecting disorganization. Over time, it rises again, showing regained structure. This aligns with the low correlation (r = −0.001) for “red card against before.”
    </p>

    <h3>Correlation Table: Contextual Events vs. Hurst Exponent</h3>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <td>Feature</td>
                <td>Correlation with H</td>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Under pressure actions</td>
                <td>+0.67</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Goals scored </td>
                <td>+0.026</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Goals conceded</td>
                <td>+0.002</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Red cards in favor</td>
                <td>+0.006</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Red cards against</td>
                <td>−0.001</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Substitution</td>
                <td>+0.021</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
        Only the pressure variable shows a strong linear correlation with H. Other contextual variables have negligible effects on possession structure when measured via the Hurst exponent.

    <h2>3.3 Correlation with Defensive Pressure Variables</h2>
    <p>
        We further studied how H correlates with pressure-specific metrics:
    </p>
    <ul class="no-bullets">
        <li>• Under pressure actions — actions executed under defensive pressure</li>
        <li>• Pression percentage — percentage of actions under pressure</li>
        <li>• Pressure events — total pressure events during possessions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Figure: Correlation Matrix Between H and Pressure Variables</h3>
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/pressing_correlation.png') }}" alt="Correlation with Pressure Variables">

    <p>Highlights:</p>
    <ul class="no-bullets">
        <li><strong>Pressure events:</strong> r = −0.89 → strong negative correlation</li>
        <li><strong>Under pressure actions:</strong> negative correlation</li>
        <li><strong>Pression percentage:</strong> negative correlation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These results confirm that pressing intensity disrupts ball circulation. H decreases significantly under pressure, capturing possession disorder in a quantitative way.
